# TicTacToeAI
This program has support for the creation of additional players and it comes with 2 built in players, a Human and an AI.
The Human, obviously has to be a human, as it sets up listeners in the window waiting for a click by the user to continue the game, the AI however, uses its knowledge based on games it played to progress in the game.
Every player has its own Manager which is responsible for stuff like saving or deleting if needed and for providing the configuration UI.
